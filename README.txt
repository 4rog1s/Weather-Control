BASIC CONTROL
Move mouse to change perspective.
Press W to move forward, S to move backward, A to move left and D to move right.
Press Q to start raining, and Press E to stop raining.
The half-transparency Canvases is for Fog of War effect, which to block some views around the character.
And the character is basically a tumbler, so you can control it to ¡°conquer¡±the mountain in the scene.
Don't mind, it won't fall over when you running toward the top on the rock wall!
HAVE FUN!
